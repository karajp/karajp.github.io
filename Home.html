<p>The reality is that most of us outlive our pets. We know this when we get them and throughout the years that they bring us joy but facing it happening is heartbreaking.</p>

<p>Most of us a lucky that we have the space, time and money to care for our pets and just to have them in our lives. I consider it a valuable experience that I grew up with pets in my childhood and hat my family could look after them. All together we’ve had a rabbit, a budgie, lots of fishes, some hermit crabs, our cat, another budgie and finally the one still standing today, our dog Bella.</p>

<p>Pets create memories and can bring you comfort as well as making you learn skills to look after them, take responsibility and in the end force you to face lose. Everyone copes in different way and has different memories of their pet’s.</p>

<p>This is the story of my cat Splodge and in memory of her beautiful feline life!</p>
