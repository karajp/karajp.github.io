	<h1>Losing a Beloved Pet</h1>
</center>
	<h2> How to cope with loss</h2>
	<p>Everyone copes with loss different. You might find it comforting to hold a ceremony in memory of your pet, create a murial or gavestone, arrange your picitures of them or even just have a talk about them. We mourn when other humans die and the same applies when a pet, especially a long term pet, passes- it can fee&nbsp; like you've lost a part of your family. </p>
	<p>Remember to talk to others if this loss affects your life negatively for too long. People who live alone and relied on their pets company may need to seek a new comfort.You have control on how you grieve and how you remember your pets life. </p>
	<p>There is also no need to rush into getting a new pet. Consider this option after you've had time to come to terms with the loss and then look at what next step you would like to take. You may want to leave getting a new pet so you have time to get away without the responsibilties, or may want to give a new pet a home fairly shortly after or alternatively you mayknow that would like a pet in the future but are just waiting for the dust to settle, or finally ypu might not be considering getting a new pet at all. </p>
	<p>Pets may not be a necessity in our lives but certainly can take a huge role in our hearts. Think about the past, present and furture to determine what suits you best and always give yourself time to remember your pets. Remember to play with them and pat them while they are around, make sure to give them attention and look after them well, look out for their health  too and don't feel bad when you become use to them gone.Our pets come into our lives and will go but we choose how we remember them. </p>

	<h2>What to do with remains</h2>
	<h3> Burial</h3>
	<p>When a pet dies some owner  prefer to bury their pets in their own yard. It's a lovely way to have your pet nearby and helps some greive. Of course you must own your own property/land to be ale to do this and must check with your state and council laws and regulations to make sure this is legal. Usually there are rules on how far down and how your pet must be buried to make sure it's not a hazard and at risk of being dug up by wild animals. This option is usually free or minimal cost.</p>

	<h2>All their things</h2>
	<p>When we gets pets we buy them essentials like food, dishes, litter trays, baskets and beds as well as toy and treats. We don't think what to do with all their things when they have gone.</p>
	<p>If planning or even considering getting the same species of pet again, then you don't have to worry about this, just remember to clean all toys and bedding and check to see if current food you a have is suitable for your new arrival.</p>
	<p>However, if you decide you have no use these things anymore look into donating them. </p>
	<p>
		<li> Check to see if any friends or family have pets that can eat the leftover pet food you have</li>
		<li> Check if family and friends pets need any more bedding, toys or collars/leads</li>
		<li> See if any animal shelters or rescue centres accept or are in need of donations</li>
		<li> See if there are any recycling shops or thrift stores in your area that accept donations</li>
		<li> If in good shape, consider selling equipment like baskets, kennels or carriers online</li>
		Remember to was all equipment you give away
