	<h1>Splodge&nbsp;</h1>
	<h2>The family cat for 13 years</h2>
	</center>
	
	<p>Splodge joined my family as a fiery but cute little kitten. Only a few weeks old, abandoned and living in a brick wall with her two siblings; this is how my sister and dad found her. I was around 6 at the time, and I remember we were on a family outing when my sister came running telling my mum and I we had to ‘go and see’. 
I remember rescuing the kittens and how Splodge was the brave one of her siblings and how shy the small grey kitten was who took forever to coax out. I also remember my sister and I begging our parents to let us keep one. I think the joke that dads don’t want to have pets but then become attached applies greatly to my dad. He had great hesitation to agreeing to keep Splodge but she ended sleeping at the foot of his bed for the last few years. 
In the end, she obviously came home with us and as you know we called her Splodge. I can’t remember who came up with the name but I know it came about due to her differing coloured patches of fur- she was a short hair, tortoiseshell cat.</p>

<p>We raised her from a 6-week-old kitten until she died due to health complications. There are so many memories from her being a mischievous kitten, having a mood attitude to showing more affection as she grew older. There was the time she used to run up my dad’s trousers to sit on his shoulders or when she jumped up to pull down door handles or when we would discover dead mice (or just their tails). She always enjoyed toying the flies trapped inside or running up for pats when she felt like it. Sometimes she would even bring us her favourite toy which read ‘I love catnip’ despite her absolute disgust in actual catnip.</p>

<p>She brought joy and comfort along with the responsibilities of being a pet owner and she will always remain as my first feline friend!</p>
